Implement 1-persistent, non-persistent and p-persistent CSMA techniques.
In this assignment, you have to implement 1-persistent, non-persistent 
and p-persistent CSMA techniques. Measure the performance parameters 
like throughput (i.e., average amount of data bits successfully 
transmitted per unit time) and forwarding delay (i.e., average 
end-to-end delay, including the queuing delay and the transmission delay) 
experienced by the CSMA frames (IEEE 802.3). Plot the comparison graphs 
for throughput and forwarding delay by varying p. State your observations 
on the impact of performance of different CSMA techniques.
