Implement three data link layer protocols, Stop and Wait, Go Back N Sliding
Window and Selective Repeat Sliding Window for flow control.

Sender, Receiver and Channel all are independent processes. There may be multiple Transmitter and
Receiver processes, but only one Channel process. The channel process introduces random delay and/or
bit error while transferring frames. Define your own frame format or you may use IEEE 802.3 Ethernet
frame format.
Hints: Some points you may consider in your design.
Following functions may be required in Sender.
Send: This function, invoked every time slot at the sender, decides if the sender should (1) do nothing,
(2) retransmit the previous data frame due to a timeout, or (3) send a new data frame. Also, you have to
consider current network time measure in time slots.
Recv_Ack: This function is invoked whenever an ACK packet is received. Need to consider network time
when the ACK was received, ack_num and timestamp are the sender's sequence number and timestamp
that were echoed in the ACK. This function must call the timeout function.
Timeout: This function should be called by ACK method to compute the most recent data packet's
round-trip time and then re-compute the value of timeout.
Following functions may be required in Receiver.
Recv: This function at the receiver is invoked upon receiving a data frame from the sender.
Send_Ack: This function is required to build the ACK and transmit.
Sliding window:
The sliding window protocols (Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat) extend the stop-and-wait protocol by
allowing the sender to have multiple frames outstanding (i.e., unacknowledged) at any given time. The
maximum number of unacknowledged frames at the sender cannot exceed its "window size". Upon
receiving a frame, the receiver sends an ACK for the frame's sequence number. The receiver then
buffers the received frames and delivers them in sequence number order to the application.
Performance metrics: Receiver Throughput (packets per time slot), RTT, bandwidth-delay product,
utilization percentage.
